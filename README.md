This is my Master thesis in Computer Engineering developed with Gianfranco Costamagna.
We developed an enegry aware wireless sensor network. The PCB of the network nodes is designed with Eagle, and it is made up of: a MSP430, a battery meter, a RTC and a CC2500 antenna.
The firmware of the microcontroller was developed with CCStudio, an IDE provided by TI.
The project could be built and tested with a MSP430 LaunchPad kit, provided by TI.
